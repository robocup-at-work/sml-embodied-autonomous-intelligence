# FAQ

## What is the SML ?
The Smart Manufacturing League (SML) is the new competition format for RoboCup Industrial from 2026 and onwards. 
It merges former @Work and RCLL concepts into a future-proof concept of an Industry 5.0 factory.

## How can I participate ?
Teams may participate in the EAI-WS workshop, as well as on-site community sessions to consolidate team feedback to refine the current concept.

## Are Humanoids mandatory ?
No. The SML explicitly encourages their exploratory use, but accepts other system designs, such as wheel-based robots, as established solutions.

## Are Fleets mandatory ?
No. Teams may participate using single agents. However, for later tiers, teams are expected to seamlessly integrate their agents into larger, heterogenous fleets.

## Is Box-Transport mandatory ?
No. Robots are allowed to carry euroboxes, but don't have to.

# I am an existing Team. Can I continue with my robot ?
Yes. We believe that all robot designs remain relevant, but may vary in individual performance across different tasks.

# Where do I get the materials ?
The technical regulations define commonly available storage shelfs and 3D-printed polymer bricks as raw materials, ensuring practical supply of core league elements for individuals and international events.

# How can I win the workshop ?
Team performances are benchmarked across three complementary tracks. 
In addition, the overall order completion rate is included score evaluations, reflecting both specialization and general system autonomy. 
We will award best-in-track certificates, as well as an overall workshop winner for the EAI-WS in 2026.

# How will the Event Schedule look like?
An example schedule for on-site events is included in the EAI-WS paper. 
While specific timings may change according to local conditions, the general structure will likely remain intact.
