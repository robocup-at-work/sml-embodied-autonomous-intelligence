# FAQ

# General

### What is the SML ?
The Smart Manufacturing League (SML) is the new competition format for RoboCup Industrial from 2026 and onwards. 
It merges former @Work and RCLL concepts into a future-proof concept of an Industry 5.0 factory.

### Why the new format ?
From 2026 onwards, both former league formats will cease to exist. To continue with RoboCup Industrial as a unified community,
a practical competition concept has to be established. One that protects legacy while dropping balast.

### Which elements are retained ?
While we abandon most former competition structures, we retain essential and well-explored robotic skills, such as navigation, manipulation, and planning.

### What is new ?
To ensure proper evaluation of planning performances, complementary standard simulators are introduced as a meaningful evaluation tool without hardware restrictions.
The workbench tasks introduce flexible robotic assembly, connecting meaningful purpose to prior abstract logistic tasks in former leagues.

### What stays the same ?
RoboCup Industrial will remain an encouraging and engaging playground for robotic researchers at any stage, 
targeting real-world problems from research and industry.
An open discussion and learning environment is fundamental for the success of the future SML.

# Participation

### Who should participate ?
For the 2026 transition year, we explicitly encourage everyone interested in contributing towards a complete SML rulebook for the upcoming seasons,
by actively participating in both vision and practical workshops on-site.

### How can I participate ?
During 2026, all teams may participate in the practical Embodied Autonomous Intelligence (EAI) workshop, as well as in on-site community sessions to consolidate team feedback and to refine the current concept.

### What Qualification Materials do I have to provide ?
A team description paper and a short video of your robot doing any task that may contribute to a track is sufficient.
Local restriction may require a selection of objectively ranked applicants.

### I am an existing Team. Am I welcome in the SML ?
Of course. We welcome all established and new teams to join the SML during 2026, and if possible, to bring their robots.

### I am a new team. How do I start ?
As long as your robot fulfills any meaningful work within the benchmark setups, participation is possible, 
and you may explore further capabilities naturally through on-site experience.

### How will the Event Schedule look like?
An example schedule for on-site events is included in the EAI-WS paper. 
While specific timings may change according to local conditions, the general structure will likely remain intact.

# Design Constraints

### May I continue with my existing robot ?
Yes. We believe that all robot designs remain relevant, but individual performances across different tasks may vary.

### Is there an optimal design for a robot ?
No. The league embraces creativity and encourages benchmarking of highly individual agents.

### Are Humanoids mandatory ?
No. The SML explicitly encourages their exploratory use, but accepts other system designs, such as wheel-based robots, as established solutions.

### Are Fleets mandatory ?
No. Teams may participate using single agents. However, for later tiers, teams are expected to seamlessly integrate their agents into larger, heterogenous fleets.

### Is Box-Transport mandatory ?
No. Robots are allowed to carry euroboxes, but don't have to.

### Where do I get the materials ?
The technical regulations define commonly available storage shelfs and 3D-printed polymer bricks as raw materials, ensuring practical supply of core league elements for individuals and international events.

## How can I win the workshop ?
Team performances are benchmarked across three complementary tracks. 
In addition, the overall order completion rate is included score evaluations, reflecting both specialization and general system autonomy. 
We will award best-in-track certificates, as well as an overall workshop winner for the EAI-WS in 2026.
