## Message to the Teams

The [message to the teams](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence/blob/main/Transition_Guide/TLDR.md) includes a minimal version
of what participants may expect during RoboCup Industrial 2026. 

TL;DR:
We invite all RoboCup Industrial teams to actively participate in on-site workshop formats and events.
All robots are welcome. The competition will be shaped through the community within safe guardrails.



## Overview

This repository contains the [official EAI workshop proposal](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence/blob/main/Embodied%20Autonomous%20Intelligence%20Workshop%20-%20V1.0.pdf) document for the
Embodied Autonomous Intelligence Workshop (EAI-WS), developed as part of the transition to the RoboCup Smart Manufacturing League (SML) starting in 2026.

The document describes:
- One concrete workshop concept
- One possible participation and benchmarking format
- One reference competition structure for the SML transition phase

It is intentionally written as a workshop proposal, not as a finalized league rulebook.
The goal is to provide teams and organizers with a clear, testable, and transparent baseline for on-site activities during the early SML seasons.

## Scope of This Document

This repository documents the EAI-WS concept, which proposes:
- A workshop-oriented participation format for the 2026 transition year
- Three complementary tracks: warehouse, workbench, and planning
- A tiered competition structure (Beginner / Advanced / Expert)
- Minimal technical regulations focused on safety and feasibility
- A scoring philosophy that rewards both specialization and system-level autonomy

The concept emphasizes:
- Solution openness
- Gradual increase of complexity
- On-site experimentation and learning
- Comparability across teams without enforcing specific architectures

## Design Philosophy

The RoboCup Industrial - EAI-WS aims to establish a future-proof community and research competition format for all career levels.
By seamlessly integrating all backgrounds into [one unified concept](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence/blob/main/Terms_and_Conditions/Vision.md), the new SML format shall remain "accessible today while crafting tomorrow". 

## Transition Guide

To ease transitions and spark excitement for all teams participating in the Embodied Autonomous Intelligence Workshop, 
the authors attached a short motivational [letter to all teams](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence/blob/main/Transition_Guide/Letter_to_the_Teams.md) of RoboCup Industrial 2026.
The letter includes a compact guide through the new competition format, 
as well as suggestions for skill developments in robotic systems.

A continously updated [FAQ](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence/blob/main/Transition_Guide/FAQ.md) shall further prevent misunderstandings early and aims to provide an easy-accessible common understanding based on straight-forward answers to deliberate design choices. 

## Disclaimer

For the 2026 transition year of the Smart Manufacturing League (SML), the [**Embodied Autonomous Intelligence Workshop (EAI-WS)**](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence/blob/main/Embodied%20Autonomous%20Intelligence%20Workshop%20-%20V1.0.pdf) serves as the **baseline workshop concept**.
The baseline:
- provides a [shared reference](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence/blob/main/Transition_Guide/Event_Information.md) point for teams and organizers,
- reflects common ground between the former @Work and RCLL communities,
- is designed to be inclusive, allowing participation with existing systems,
- emphasizes performance differentiation through task outcomes rather than eligibility constraints.

The baseline concept is **not final or immutable**. It is intended as a practical starting point that enables teams to prepare, participate, and provide meaningful feedback based on real experience.
All discussions, feedback, and proposed refinements are expected to **reference this baseline explicitly**, unless a fully alternative concept is being proposed.

## How to Contribute

### Online Feedback

Teams and contributors are invited to use the GitHub Issues section to:
- Propose ideas or extensions
- Discuss open questions
- Suggest refinements or alternatives
- Share concerns based on preparation or on-site experience

### Hands-On Experience

The EAI-WS leaves certain aspects of the competition deliberately open for community refinement, especially where:
- Practical constraints only become clear on-site
- Decisions benefit from direct team input
- Physical interaction, timing, or arena logistics matter

These elements are expected to be refined collaboratively during real events.


### Committee Formation & On-Site Decisions

A new SML committee (TC and OC) is expected to be formed during 2026.
The EAI-WS concept intentionally leaves certain aspects open, 
which shall be refined by through the community and [local TC/OC elections](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence/blob/main/Terms_and_Conditions/TC_OC_Elections.md).

### Important Timeline Note

Due to short preparation timelines for real events:
- Feedback submitted via GitHub will not be integrated immediately
- Planned integration points are:
- - After the German Open
  - Potentially after the RoboCup World Championship (South Korea)

This approach ensures:
- Equal preparation conditions for all teams
- No late rule or concept changes that would disadvantage early preparation
- A fair transition into future SML iterations



## Process for Feedback, On-Site Discussions, and Decisions

The Embodied Autonomous Intelligence Workshop (EAI-WS) is designed as a collaborative and evolving format. Feedback from the community—both on-site and online—is explicitly welcome and encouraged.

To ensure that ideas can be integrated meaningfully while keeping the process workable, feedback is handled through a fair and constructive [process](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence/blob/main/Terms_and_Conditions/Feedback_Process.md).


## Community Guidelines & Code of Conduct

The EAI-WS workshop is designed as an open, inclusive, and experimental environment that brings together teams with diverse backgrounds, robot platforms, and research goals. We explicitly welcome heterogeneous approaches and encourage creative exploration.

To ensure a productive and respectful experience for all participants, we ask everyone to adhere to our [guideline principles](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence/blob/main/Terms_and_Conditions/Guidelines.md).


## Committee Structure & Governance

To ensure transparency, continuity, and effective decision-making during the transition to the Smart Manufacturing League (SML), the following committee structure is proposed.

### Executive Committee (EC)

The active Executive Committees of the former RoboCup @Work and RCLL leagues will form the initial SML Executive Committee, effective January 2026.
The EC is responsible for overall direction, long-term vision, and final decisions on league structure and governance.

### Organizing Committee (OC) and Technical Committee (TC)

For each major event (e.g., German Open, World Cup), an Organizing Committee (OC) and a Technical Committee (TC) will be formed.

All participants are invited to apply for OC or TC positions.
Please refer to the [TC/OC Election Process](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence/blob/main/Terms_and_Conditions/TC_OC_Elections.md) and the [role descriptions](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence/blob/main/Terms_and_Conditions/Committee_Roles.md) for more information.

## Final Note

The EAI-WS is designed as:
- A transition mechanism
- A shared technical baseline
- A discussion catalyst for shaping SML together

Constructive feedback, alternative visions, and community involvement are not only welcome — they are essential to the success of the Smart Manufacturing League.
