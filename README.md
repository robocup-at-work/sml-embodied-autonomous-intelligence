# Embodied Autonomous Intelligence Workshop (EAI-WS)
*A Workshop Proposal for the RoboCup Smart Manufacturing League (SML)*

## Letter to the Teams

Dear RoboCup Industrial Teams,

we’re excited to finally share an update on the Smart Manufacturing League (SML) and how we’ll move forward in 2026!

Over the past months, the SML Executive Committee—together with members of the former @Work and Logistics League communities—has developed a shared vision for the future of RoboCup Industrial. This vision focuses on openness, gradual evolution, and broad participation, while allowing teams to build on their existing systems.

For the 2026 transition year, we will proceed with the **Embodied Autonomous Intelligence Workshop (EAI-WS)**. The EAI-WS is designed as an inclusive, challenge-style workshop that:

* welcomes all teams and robot platforms,
* allows participation with existing systems,
* encourages incremental improvements toward higher autonomy.

At the start of the event, a **Vision Session** will be held to present the workshop concept, answer questions, and openly discuss open points together with all teams. Based on on-site experience and feedback, elements of the workshop can be refined collaboratively.

We encourage teams to review the published concept, prepare their systems accordingly, and bring questions or ideas—either to the Vision Session, on-site discussions, or via GitHub.

The EAI-WS concept and resources are available here:
👉 [https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence)

We’re very much looking forward to seeing the community come together, experimenting, learning from each other, and shaping the future of RoboCup Industrial step by step.

See you at the events!

Best regards,

The Smart Manufacturing League Executive Committee



## Overview

This repository contains the official workshop proposal document for the
Embodied Autonomous Intelligence Workshop (EAI-WS), developed as part of the transition to the RoboCup Smart Manufacturing League (SML) starting in 2026.

The document describes:
- One concrete workshop concept
- One possible participation and benchmarking format
- One reference competition structure for the SML transition phase

It is intentionally written as a workshop proposal, not as a finalized league rulebook.
The goal is to provide teams and organizers with a clear, testable, and transparent baseline for on-site activities during the early SML seasons.

## Scope of This Document

This repository documents the EAI-WS concept, which proposes:
- A workshop-oriented participation format for the 2026 transition year
- Three complementary tracks: warehouse, workbench, and planning
- A tiered competition structure (Beginner / Advanced / Expert)
- Minimal technical regulations focused on safety and feasibility
- A scoring philosophy that rewards both specialization and system-level autonomy

The concept emphasizes:
- Solution openness
- Gradual increase of complexity
- On-site experimentation and learning
- Comparability across teams without enforcing specific architectures

## Disclaimer

This document represents one possible workshop and competition concept for the Smart Manufacturing League.

At the time of writing:
- No single, unified vision for SML has been finalized across all stakeholders
- Multiple valid interpretations of tasks, scoring, and league structure exist

Therefore:
- This proposal should be understood as a reference implementation
- Alternative workshop formats or competition concepts are explicitly welcome
- Other teams or committees may publish competing or complementary proposals

Future SML events may adopt:
- This concept
- A modified version of it
- Or a different approach entirely

The EAI-WS is intended to support structured exploration, not to pre-empt community or committee decisions.

## How to Contribute
### Committee Formation & On-Site Decisions

A new SML committee is expected to be formed during 2026.
The EAI-WS concept intentionally leaves certain aspects open, especially where:
- Practical constraints only become clear on-site
- Decisions benefit from direct team input
- Physical interaction, timing, or arena logistics matter
- These elements are expected to be refined collaboratively during real events.

### Feedback

Teams and contributors are invited to use the GitHub Issues section to:
- Propose ideas or extensions
- Discuss open questions
- Suggest refinements or alternatives
- Share concerns based on preparation or on-site experience

### Important Timeline Note

Due to short preparation timelines for real events:
- Feedback submitted via GitHub will not be integrated immediately
- Planned integration points are:
- - After the German Open
  - Potentially after the RoboCup World Championship (South Korea)

This approach ensures:
- Equal preparation conditions for all teams
- No late rule or concept changes that would disadvantage early preparation
- A fair transition into future SML iterations

## Final Note

The EAI-WS is designed as:
- A transition mechanism
- A shared technical baseline
- A discussion catalyst for shaping SML together

Constructive feedback, alternative visions, and community involvement are not only welcome — they are essential to the success of the Smart Manufacturing League.
