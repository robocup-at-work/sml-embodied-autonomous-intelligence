# NOT OFFICIALLY FINALIZED YET

# Embodied Autonomous Intelligence Workshop (EAI-WS)
*A Workshop Proposal for the RoboCup Smart Manufacturing League (SML)*

## Letter to the Teams

Dear RoboCup Industrial Teams,

**TL;DR**: *We will proceed with two complementary SML workshop concepts that share the same arena and materials, allowing teams to test both approaches and help converge towards a unified league concept for 2026 and beyond.*

Many of you have been eager to hear how the Smart Manufacturing League (SML) will take shape for RoboCup 2026. Recent discussions within the RoboCup @Work and RCLL communities have led to a strong shared understanding of the overall direction towards Industry 5.0 and beyond.
While we share substantial common ground in vision, tasks, and robot designs, our ideas on how these should be implemented into a concrete competition format have not fully converged so far.

To move forward constructively and gather practical experience as well as your feedback, we have decided to proceed with two complementary workshop concepts for the RoboCup German Open 2026. Both will use the same arena layout and materials specification, ensuring comparability and allowing teams to participate in both formats using their existing systems.

The concept papers will be hosted publicly, and teams are explicitly encouraged to raise questions and suggest improvements transparently via GitHub issues. Our shared goal is to converge towards a robust and community-driven SML concept for RoboCup 2026 in Korea, 2027, and beyond.

We strongly encourage teams to participate in all workshop formats. Most existing systems should already be able to perform a substantial subset of the proposed tasks.

We are looking forward to shaping a strong and unified RoboCup Industrial community together.

## Overview

This repository contains the official workshop proposal document for the
Embodied Autonomous Intelligence Workshop (EAI-WS), developed as part of the transition to the RoboCup Smart Manufacturing League (SML) starting in 2026.

The document describes:
- One concrete workshop concept
- One possible participation and benchmarking format
- One reference competition structure for the SML transition phase

It is intentionally written as a workshop proposal, not as a finalized league rulebook.
The goal is to provide teams and organizers with a clear, testable, and transparent baseline for on-site activities during the early SML seasons.

## Scope of This Document

This repository documents the EAI-WS concept, which proposes:
- A workshop-oriented participation format for the 2026 transition year
- Three complementary tracks: warehouse, workbench, and planning
- A tiered competition structure (Beginner / Advanced / Expert)
- Minimal technical regulations focused on safety and feasibility
- A scoring philosophy that rewards both specialization and system-level autonomy

The concept emphasizes:
- Solution openness
- Gradual increase of complexity
- On-site experimentation and learning
- Comparability across teams without enforcing specific architectures

## Disclaimer

This document represents one possible workshop and competition concept for the Smart Manufacturing League.

At the time of writing:
- No single, unified vision for SML has been finalized across all stakeholders
- Multiple valid interpretations of tasks, scoring, and league structure exist

Therefore:
- This proposal should be understood as a reference implementation
- Alternative workshop formats or competition concepts are explicitly welcome
- Other teams or committees may publish competing or complementary proposals

Future SML events may adopt:
- This concept
- A modified version of it
- Or a different approach entirely

The EAI-WS is intended to support structured exploration, not to pre-empt community or committee decisions.

## How to Contribute
### Committee Formation & On-Site Decisions

A new SML committee is expected to be formed during 2026.
The EAI-WS concept intentionally leaves certain aspects open, especially where:
- Practical constraints only become clear on-site
- Decisions benefit from direct team input
- Physical interaction, timing, or arena logistics matter
- These elements are expected to be refined collaboratively during real events.

### Feedback

Teams and contributors are invited to use the GitHub Issues section to:
- Propose ideas or extensions
- Discuss open questions
- Suggest refinements or alternatives
- Share concerns based on preparation or on-site experience

### Important Timeline Note

Due to short preparation timelines for real events:
- Feedback submitted via GitHub will not be integrated immediately
- Planned integration points are:
- - After the German Open
  - Potentially after the RoboCup World Championship (South Korea)

This approach ensures:
- Equal preparation conditions for all teams
- No late rule or concept changes that would disadvantage early preparation
- A fair transition into future SML iterations

## Final Note

The EAI-WS is designed as:
- A transition mechanism
- A shared technical baseline
- A discussion catalyst for shaping SML together

Constructive feedback, alternative visions, and community involvement are not only welcome — they are essential to the success of the Smart Manufacturing League.
