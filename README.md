## Message to the Teams

Dear RoboCup Industrial Teams,

we’re excited to finally share an update on the Smart Manufacturing League (SML) and how we’ll move forward in 2026!

Over the past months, the SML Executive Committee—together with members of the former @Work and Logistics League communities—has developed a shared vision for the future of RoboCup Industrial. This vision focuses on openness, gradual evolution, and broad participation, while allowing teams to build on their existing systems.

For the 2026 transition year, we will proceed with the **Embodied Autonomous Intelligence Workshop (EAI-WS)**. The EAI-WS is designed as an inclusive, challenge-style workshop that:

* welcomes all teams and robot platforms,
* allows participation with existing systems,
* encourages incremental improvements toward higher autonomy.

At the start of the event, a **Vision Session** will be held to present the workshop concept, answer questions, and openly discuss open points together with all teams. Based on on-site experience and feedback, elements of the workshop can be refined collaboratively.

We encourage teams to review the published concept, prepare their systems accordingly, and bring questions or ideas—either to the Vision Session, on-site discussions, or via GitHub.

The EAI-WS concept and resources are available here:
👉 [https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence)

We’re very much looking forward to seeing the community come together, experimenting, learning from each other, and shaping the future of RoboCup Industrial step by step.

See you at the events!

Best regards,

*Marco*

*on behalf of the Smart Manufacturing League Executive Committee*



## Overview

This repository contains the official workshop proposal document for the
Embodied Autonomous Intelligence Workshop (EAI-WS), developed as part of the transition to the RoboCup Smart Manufacturing League (SML) starting in 2026.

The document describes:
- One concrete workshop concept
- One possible participation and benchmarking format
- One reference competition structure for the SML transition phase

It is intentionally written as a workshop proposal, not as a finalized league rulebook.
The goal is to provide teams and organizers with a clear, testable, and transparent baseline for on-site activities during the early SML seasons.

## Scope of This Document

This repository documents the EAI-WS concept, which proposes:
- A workshop-oriented participation format for the 2026 transition year
- Three complementary tracks: warehouse, workbench, and planning
- A tiered competition structure (Beginner / Advanced / Expert)
- Minimal technical regulations focused on safety and feasibility
- A scoring philosophy that rewards both specialization and system-level autonomy

The concept emphasizes:
- Solution openness
- Gradual increase of complexity
- On-site experimentation and learning
- Comparability across teams without enforcing specific architectures

## Design Philosophy

RoboCup Industrial must aim to establish a future-proof community and research competition format for all career levels.
By seamlessly integrating all backgrounds into one unified concept, the new SML format shall remain "accessible today while crafting tomorrow".

## Disclaimer

This document describes the current baseline workshop concept for the Smart Manufacturing League (SML) transition phase.

The EAI-WS reflects a shared understanding within the SML Executive Committee on the general direction, scope, and structure of SML activities for the 2026 season. It is intended to provide teams with a concrete and actionable reference for preparation and participation.

While broad alignment exists on this baseline, discussions on specific design choices, extensions, and future developments are ongoing. As such:
- The EAI-WS should be understood as a reference implementation, not a final league rulebook
- Constructive feedback and refinement proposals are explicitly welcome
- Adjustments may be made based on on-site experience and structured community input

The purpose of the EAI-WS is to enable practical experimentation and informed iteration, not to pre-empt future committee decisions for subsequent seasons.


## How to Contribute

### Committee Formation & On-Site Decisions

A new SML committee (TC and OC) is expected to be formed during 2026.
The EAI-WS concept intentionally leaves certain aspects open, especially where:
- Practical constraints only become clear on-site
- Decisions benefit from direct team input
- Physical interaction, timing, or arena logistics matter
- These elements are expected to be refined collaboratively during real events.

### Feedback

Teams and contributors are invited to use the GitHub Issues section to:
- Propose ideas or extensions
- Discuss open questions
- Suggest refinements or alternatives
- Share concerns based on preparation or on-site experience

### Important Timeline Note

Due to short preparation timelines for real events:
- Feedback submitted via GitHub will not be integrated immediately
- Planned integration points are:
- - After the German Open
  - Potentially after the RoboCup World Championship (South Korea)

This approach ensures:
- Equal preparation conditions for all teams
- No late rule or concept changes that would disadvantage early preparation
- A fair transition into future SML iterations

### Baseline Workshop Concept

For the 2026 transition year of the Smart Manufacturing League (SML), the **Embodied Autonomous Intelligence Workshop (EAI-WS)** serves as the **baseline workshop concept**.
The baseline:
- provides a shared reference point for teams and organizers,
- reflects common ground between the former @Work and RCLL communities,
- is designed to be inclusive, allowing participation with existing systems,
- emphasizes performance differentiation through task outcomes rather than eligibility constraints.

The baseline concept is **not final or immutable**. It is intended as a practical starting point that enables teams to prepare, participate, and provide meaningful feedback based on real experience.
All discussions, feedback, and proposed refinements are expected to **reference this baseline explicitly**, unless a fully alternative concept is being proposed.

## Process for Feedback, On-Site Discussions, and Decisions

The Embodied Autonomous Intelligence Workshop (EAI-WS) is designed as a collaborative and evolving format. Feedback from the community—both on-site and online—is explicitly welcome and encouraged.

To ensure that ideas can be integrated meaningfully while keeping the process workable, feedback is handled as follows:

### 1. Sources of feedback

Feedback may be provided through:
- GitHub Issues (preferred for detailed or technical feedback),
- Vision Sessions and on-site discussions during events,
- Direct discussions with EC members during the workshop.

All forms of feedback are considered valuable input.

### 2. Collection and consolidation

Feedback gathered on-site or through informal discussions will be:

- collected by members of the SML Executive Committee (EC),
- consolidated where similar or overlapping points are raised by multiple teams,
- summarized if different interpretations or perspectives on the same topic exist.

This step ensures that repeated or conflicting feedback is captured clearly and fairly, without requiring every team to debate every detail directly.

### 3. Evaluation and decision

The consolidated feedback is then reviewed within the Executive Committee.

Decisions on:
- clarifications,
- refinements,
- extensions, or
- changes to the workshop concept

are made within this circle.

This process allows all ideas to be heard, while ensuring that decisions remain manageable, consistent, and aligned with the overall vision.

### 4. Transparency and follow-up

Where relevant:
- outcomes of EC discussions will be reflected in updates to the documentation,
- clarifications or rationale may be added to the repository or communicated during follow-up sessions,
- unresolved or exploratory ideas may be deferred to future iterations or experiments.

The goal is not to accept or reject ideas immediately, but to integrate them responsibly based on shared experience and feasibility.

### 5. Guiding principle

All ideas are welcome.
Not all ideas need to be decided immediately.

This structure is intended to balance **openness and inclusivity** with the need for **clear decisions and forward progress**, especially during the SML transition phase.


## Community Guidelines & Code of Conduct

The EAI-WS workshop is designed as an open, inclusive, and experimental environment that brings together teams with diverse backgrounds, robot platforms, and research goals. We explicitly welcome heterogeneous approaches and encourage creative exploration.

To ensure a productive and respectful experience for all participants, we ask everyone to adhere to the following principles:

#### Respectful and substantial discussion:
Passionate technical discussions are welcome and encouraged. Criticism should always focus on ideas, designs, or results — never on individuals or teams.
#### Good-faith participation
The workshop is not intended for adversarial behavior or strategic exploitation of ambiguities in the design philosophy. Approaches that intentionally undermine the spirit of fair comparison or collaboration may be excluded from evaluation.
#### No architectural gatekeeping
All robot platforms and system architectures are welcome. There is no guarantee that every approach will perform equally well across all tasks — as in real-world industrial settings, outcomes depend on design choices and trade-offs.

#### Fair play and sportsmanship
Unsportsmanlike behavior, including deliberate attempts to gain advantage through technical loopholes, excessive handicapping of others, or disruptive conduct, will not be tolerated.

#### Experimental mindset
The workshop is a learning-oriented environment. Unexpected results, partial solutions, and failure cases are considered valuable outcomes and should be treated constructively.

The executive committee reserves the right to intervene in cases where these principles are violated, with the goal of preserving a safe, fair, and collaborative environment for all participants.


## Committee Structure & Governance

To ensure transparency, continuity, and effective decision-making during the transition to the Smart Manufacturing League (SML), the following committee structure is proposed.

### Executive Committee (EC)

The active Executive Committees of the former RoboCup @Work and RCLL leagues will form the initial SML Executive Committee, effective January 2026.
The EC is responsible for overall direction, long-term vision, and final decisions on league structure and governance.

### Organizing Committee (OC) and Technical Committee (TC)

For each major event (e.g., German Open, World Cup), an Organizing Committee (OC) and a Technical Committee (TC) will be formed.

All participants are invited to apply for OC or TC positions.
Please refer to the [TC/OC Election Process](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence/blob/main/TC_OC_Elections.md) and the [role descriptions](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence/blob/main/Committee_Roles.md) for more information.

## Final Note

The EAI-WS is designed as:
- A transition mechanism
- A shared technical baseline
- A discussion catalyst for shaping SML together

Constructive feedback, alternative visions, and community involvement are not only welcome — they are essential to the success of the Smart Manufacturing League.
