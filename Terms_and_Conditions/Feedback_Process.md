# Feedback Process

This structure is intended to balance **openness and inclusivity** with the need for **clear decisions and forward progress**, especially during the SML transition phase.

## 1. Sources of feedback

Feedback may be provided through:
- GitHub Issues (preferred for detailed or technical feedback),
- Vision Sessions and on-site discussions during events,
- Direct discussions with EC members during the workshop.

All forms of feedback are considered valuable input.

## 2. Collection and consolidation

Feedback gathered on-site or through informal discussions will be:

- collected by members of the SML Executive Committee (EC),
- consolidated where similar or overlapping points are raised by multiple teams,
- summarized if different interpretations or perspectives on the same topic exist.

This step ensures that repeated or conflicting feedback is captured clearly and fairly, without requiring every team to debate every detail directly.

## 3. Evaluation and decision

The consolidated feedback is then reviewed within the Executive Committee.

Decisions on:
- clarifications,
- refinements,
- extensions, or
- changes to the workshop concept

are made within this circle.

This process allows all ideas to be heard, while ensuring that decisions remain manageable, consistent, and aligned with the overall vision.

## 4. Transparency and follow-up

Where relevant:
- outcomes of EC discussions will be reflected in updates to the documentation,
- clarifications or rationale may be added to the repository or communicated during follow-up sessions,
- unresolved or exploratory ideas may be deferred to future iterations or experiments.

The goal is not to accept or reject ideas immediately, but to integrate them responsibly based on shared experience and feasibility.

## 5. Guiding principle

All ideas are welcome.
Not all ideas need to be decided immediately.
