# Guidelines

## Respectful and substantial discussion
Passionate technical discussions are welcome and encouraged. Criticism should always focus on ideas, designs, or results — never on individuals or teams.

## Good-faith participation
The workshop is not intended for adversarial behavior or strategic exploitation of ambiguities in the design philosophy. Approaches that intentionally undermine the spirit of fair comparison or collaboration may be excluded from evaluation.

## No architectural gatekeeping
All robot platforms and system architectures are welcome. There is no guarantee that every approach will perform equally well across all tasks — as in real-world industrial settings, outcomes depend on design choices and trade-offs.

## Fair play and sportsmanship
Unsportsmanlike behavior, including deliberate attempts to gain advantage through technical loopholes, excessive handicapping of others, or disruptive conduct, will not be tolerated.

## Experimental mindset
The workshop is a learning-oriented environment. Unexpected results, partial solutions, and failure cases are considered valuable outcomes and should be treated constructively.

## Disclaimer

The executive committee reserves the right to intervene in cases where these principles are violated, with the goal of preserving a safe, fair, and collaborative environment for all participants.
