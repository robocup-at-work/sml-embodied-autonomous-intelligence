# TC / OC Elections and Committee Formation

This section describes the initial process for forming the Technical Committee (TC) and Organizing Committee (OC) for the Smart Manufacturing League (SML).
The goal is to ensure transparency, inclusiveness, and continuity, while keeping the process lightweight and accessible for all participating teams.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Technical Committee (TC)
Responsible for the technical scope of the league, including task definitions, evaluation criteria, rule interpretation, and long-term technical direction.

### Organizing Committee (OC)
Responsible for organizational aspects such as event preparation, schedules, infrastructure coordination, and communication with teams and hosts.

Both committees are volunteer-based and work in close coordination with each other and with the league’s Executive Committee (EC).

## Eligibility

All actively participating teams in the league are eligible to:

- nominate candidates for TC and OC positions
- participate in the election process

Candidates are expected to:

- act in the interest of the league as a whole
- communicate respectfully and constructively
- represent diverse perspectives within the community

## Election Process (Standard Procedure)

### Call for Candidates
Interested participants may submit a short statement including:
- name and affiliation
- past involvement or contributions
- motivation and perspective

### Community Voting

Voting is conducted by the participating teams.
Each team has an equal vote.
Voting procedures and timelines are announced in advance.

### Committee Formation

TC and OC members are selected based on the election results.
Committees nominate a lead from within to coordinate activities and ensure progress.
This procedure follows the general principle that TC and OC members are selected by the community.

## Transitional Safeguards (If Needed)

During phases of major transition (e.g., league mergers, first-year operation), voting outcomes may be strongly skewed due to differences in team population or prior league affiliation.
If such an imbalance would significantly reduce diversity of experience or perspective, the following temporary safeguard may be applied:

The EC may moderate the final committee composition to ensure:
- representation of different backgrounds and experiences
- continuity across former league communities

Any such adjustment is:
- documented transparently
- limited to the transition phase
- intended to stabilize, not override, community governance

The standard community election process remains the default and long-term goal.

## Term and Rotation

TC and OC members serve for a fixed term (e.g., aligned with federation guidelines).

Regular rotation is encouraged to:

- distribute responsibility
- avoid stagnation
- enable new contributors to take active roles

## Code of Conduct and Expectations

All committee members are expected to:
- act respectfully and professionally
- encourage open and substantive discussion
- avoid personal attacks or exclusionary behavior
- prioritize the long-term health of the league over individual interests

A clear and shared understanding of conduct is essential to maintaining a constructive and welcoming competition environment.

## Living Document

This process description is considered a living document.
It may evolve based on:
- community feedback
- practical experience at events
- alignment with federation-level governance

Any changes will be communicated transparently.
