## Smart Manufacturing League

The SML aims to establish a new community that connects researchers at any career level.
Inclusion and accessibility for Beginners will always remain equally relevant as innovation and research prospects for experts.
By seamlessly connecting newcomers, legacy teams, and industrial partners, mutual collaboration efforts can emerge naturally from shared interests.

## Ambitions for the Embodied Autonomous Intelligence Workshop

### Short Term Goals
- Successful Merger of two legacy Formats
- Accessible to all Career Levels
- Experimental discovery of real-world Trade-offs
- Foster and reward strong Innovation
- Building a future-proof Community

### Long Term Goals
- Embodied Autonomous Intelligence in Robotic Agents and Fleets by 2050
- Pursue research Relevance and Popularity

## Towards Embodied Autonomous Intelligence

### Vision
- Define Guardrails and let the community shape the Trajectory
- Provide connection paradigms instead of coordination rules
- Embrace legacy as a resource, not a weapon

### Direction
- Initial concepts specify conditions, not winning strategies
- Details are shaped based on community feedback and practical experience
- Insights are shared, not protected

### Destination
- Building a novel, fully inclusive community for everyone
- Let approaches be constrained by trade-offs, not regulations
- Let collaboration emerge from mutual efforts, not arbitrary barriers

## Embraced Concepts

- Small toy bricks and containers as the core elements for smart production and recycling tasks
- Practical participation Conditions for teams and robotic agents
- Track-based benchmarking of modern robotic research domains
- Robust fleet controls for heterogeneous agents, including Human Workers, Specialized Robots, and embodied Androids.
- Embodied Intelligence and Social Interaction as the long-term goal

## Vision Sessions for responsible Feedback

The community shapes the details of the competition format within the local committee.
Dedicated focus areas support inclusive and productive discussions from within the new community.
Iterative specification and refinement cycles ensure steady progress while allowing teams to follow at their own pace.
