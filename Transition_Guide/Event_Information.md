# Event Information

## Preliminary Schedule

This is the preliminary schedule for the German Open and World Cup in 2026.
The exact timeline may be subject to change, according to local event conditions.

- **Day 1 – Welcome Session (90 min):**
  Introduction of the SML and EAI workshop concept, scope, participation framework, and committee setup.

- **Day 1 – Q&A Session (after a longer break):**
  Clarification-focused session after teams had time to read the paper and discuss internally. No structural decisions, only resolving misunderstandings and collecting open questions.

- **Day 2 – Refinement Session (90 min):**
  Structured discussion split into
  – short-term aspects (how to participate and succeed in 2026) and
  – long-term aspects (what could evolve in future editions).
  The goal is convergence on priorities and principles, not full rule finalization.

- **Days 2–4 – Informal practical feedback slots:**
  For minor clarifications, operational details, and practical feedback that may influence fine-grained adjustments.
