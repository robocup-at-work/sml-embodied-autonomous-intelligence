# FAQ

## General

### What is the Smart Manufacturing League (SML)?
The Smart Manufacturing League (SML) is the new competition format for RoboCup Industrial, starting in 2026.
It merges and evolves concepts from the former @Work and RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL) into a future-oriented framework aligned with Industry 5.0 research.

---

### Why was a new format introduced?
From 2026 onwards, the former RoboCup Industrial league formats will no longer continue independently.
To maintain a unified and active RoboCup Industrial community, a new format is required that:
- preserves valuable legacy experience,
- removes unnecessary structural constraints, and
- supports modern research questions in autonomy, planning, and coordination.

---

### Which elements are retained from previous leagues?
The SML retains well-established robotic capabilities such as:
- autonomous navigation,
- manipulation,
- task and mission planning,
- coordination between agents.

These skills remain central to the league and are exercised in updated contexts.

---

### What is new compared to previous formats?
New elements include:
- standardized simulation environments to benchmark planning and coordination independently of hardware,
- flexible workbench and assembly tasks that connect logistics, manipulation, and planning in a meaningful way,
- increased emphasis on system autonomy and decision-making rather than fixed task scripts.

---

### What stays the same?
RoboCup Industrial remains an open and encouraging environment for robotics researchers at all experience levels.
Hands-on experimentation, knowledge exchange, and constructive discussion remain core values of the SML.

---

## Participation

### Why should I participate in 2026?
The 2026 season is a transition year.
Teams are explicitly encouraged to participate in order to:
- gain early experience with the new format,
- provide feedback based on real-world execution,
- help shape the complete SML rulebook for future seasons.

---

### How can I participate?
During 2026, teams may participate in:
- the practical **Embodied Autonomous Intelligence Workshop (EAI-WS)**,
- on-site vision and community sessions aimed at consolidating feedback and refining open aspects of the concept.

---

### What qualification material is required?
Typically, teams are expected to provide:
- a short team description,
- a brief video demonstrating relevant robot capabilities.

Local event constraints may require selection if capacity is limited.

---

### I am an existing team. Can I continue with my robot?
Yes.
All existing teams are welcome to participate, and existing robots remain valid platforms within the SML.

---

### I am a new team. How do I start?
As long as your robot can perform any meaningful work within the benchmark setups, participation is possible.
Additional capabilities can be explored incrementally through on-site experience and iteration.

---

### What does the event schedule look like?
An example on-site schedule is included in the EAI-WS paper.
While exact timings may vary depending on the event, the overall structure is expected to remain comparable.

---

## Design Constraints

### Can I continue using my existing robot design?
Yes.
Different robot designs may perform differently across tasks, but no specific design is required.

---

### Is there an optimal robot design?
No.
The SML explicitly encourages diverse and creative system designs and aims to benchmark a wide range of approaches.

---

### Are humanoid robots required?
No.
Humanoid robots are welcome as exploratory systems, but wheel-based and other established platforms are equally valid.

---

### Are multi-robot fleets mandatory?
No.
Teams may participate with a single agent.
More advanced tiers may later involve integration into heterogeneous fleets, but this is not required for entry.

---

### Is box transport mandatory?
No.
Robots may carry standardized containers (e.g., Euroboxes), but box transport is not a mandatory requirement.

---

### Where do I obtain materials?
The technical regulations define commonly available components, such as standard shelving and 3D-printed polymer elements, to ensure accessibility across international events.

---

## Scoring

### How are points awarded?
Points are awarded for autonomous task execution, including:
- navigation,
- deliveries,
- assembly,
- planning performance,
- completed product orders.

---

### Is human–robot interaction (HRI) rewarded?
HRI is not scored directly.
Teams may use HRI to bridge capability gaps, but scoring focuses on autonomous system performance.
Completed orders are scored independently of fleet composition.

---

### Are collaborations between teams allowed?
Yes.
Teams may collaborate across complementary tasks or tracks.
Points earned through collaboration are shared between the participating teams.

---

### How is planning performance evaluated?
Evaluation may combine:
- standardized benchmarking in simulation,
- real-world metrics such as success rates, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and re-planning behavior.

---

### How is the workshop winner determined?
Performance is benchmarked across multiple complementary tracks.
Best-in-track certificates may be awarded, as well as an overall EAI-WS workshop winner for the 2026 season.

## EAI-WS

### Isn’t this similar to “Overcooked”?
There are conceptual similarities in task coordination and decision-based planning.
In that sense, robots may be viewed as agents collaboratively preparing products.
The analogy is intentional and helps illustrate coordination challenges in an intuitive way.
