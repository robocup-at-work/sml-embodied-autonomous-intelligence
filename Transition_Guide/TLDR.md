# Message to the Teams - TL;DR

Dear RoboCup Industrial Teams,

we’re excited to finally share an update on the Smart Manufacturing League (SML) and how we’ll move forward in 2026!

Over the past months, the SML Executive Committee—together with members of the former @Work and Logistics League communities—has developed a shared vision for the future of RoboCup Industrial. 
This vision focuses on openness, gradual evolution, and broad participation, while allowing teams to build on their existing systems.

For the 2026 transition year, we will proceed with the Embodied Autonomous Intelligence Workshop (EAI-WS). The EAI-WS is designed as an inclusive, challenge-style workshop that:

- welcomes all teams and robot platforms,
- allows participation with existing systems,
- encourages incremental improvements toward higher autonomy.

At the start of the event, a Vision Session will be held to present the workshop concept, answer questions, and openly discuss open points together with all teams. 
Based on on-site experience and feedback, elements of the workshop can be refined collaboratively.

We encourage teams to review the published concept, prepare their systems accordingly, and bring questions or ideas—either to the Vision Session, on-site discussions, or via GitHub.

The EAI-WS concept and resources are available here: 👉 https://github.com/robocup-at-work/sml-embodied-autonomous-intelligence

We’re very much looking forward to seeing the community come together, experimenting, learning from each other, and shaping the future of RoboCup Industrial step by step.

See you at the events!

Best regards,

Marco

on behalf of the Smart Manufacturing League Executive Committee
